# Freesmee Desktop

Freesmee (formerly called JackSMS) is an application used to send free SMS from your pc and your mobile devices exploiting internet.
With Freesmee the user can save money by sending SMS to everybody, for free or on the cheap.

Freesmee is easy to use and absolutely free! (*and now the desktop client even open source!*)

## How does it work?

There are three ways to send an SMS using Freesmee:
* *Messaging services available on the web*: Some website and mobile providers are granting some free daily/monthly messages to their users. Freesmee has over 40 integrated services and you can also write your own ones to be able to easily send SMS using your sms web provider.

* *Integrated messenger*: Send unlimited **Free+** messages to other Freesmee users.

* *Cheap SMS packages from our provider*: The user <u>can</u> also buy **SMS+** messages on the cheap on [freesmee.com](http://www.freesmee.com).

## Which devices are supported?

Freesmee is available on:

* Windows, Linux and Mac as a standalone application based on the Qt framework.

  * What you can find in this repository is the source code of this version.
